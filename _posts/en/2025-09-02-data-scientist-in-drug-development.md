# The Intersection of Clinical Research and Data Science: Opportunities with AI and Biomarkers

The convergence of clinical research and data science is bringing revolutionary changes to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries. The integration of vast clinical trial data with cutting-edge multi-omics technologies such as single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and spatial transcriptomics provides unprecedented insights into disease mechanisms and patient stratification.

Today, a Clinical Scientist is no longer just a data manager but a key professional extracting meaningful insights from clinical data using AI, machine learning (ML), and advanced bioinformatics.

Especially, circulating tumor cell (CTC) analysis offers a groundbreaking, non-invasive way to monitor tumor heterogeneity and dynamics in the bloodstream in real time, and its integration with scRNA-seq and AI-based analysis greatly advances precision oncology.

Global leaders like Pfizer, Genentech, and Bristol-Myers Squibb are intensifying investments in such data-driven research, focusing on improved drug development and clinical outcomes.

This blog covers:
- AI/ML models specialized in clinical and multi-omics data  
- Core technologies and pipelines for analyzing CTC and single-cell data  
- Reviews of recent research papers and practical implementation methods  
- Evolution of the Clinical Scientist role and comparison of global clinical research environments  
- Current state of clinical research in Korea vs. global trends  
- Career development strategies at the intersection of clinical research and data science

We look forward to growing and innovating together with researchers, clinicians, and data scientists passionate about clinical and life science data.
